# EZ React starter

Starter app for EZReact

This repo is made to show how you can use EZ React in your own projects. 
All you need to do is add ezreact as a dependency and you'll have a setup
with hot reload that's fully ES 2015 ready.

The upside to using this repo is that you don't have to worry about
setting up your environment. It's all set up for you. All you
have to do is code your app.

It uses only one dependency - `ezreact`.

# Instructions

Clone this repo and run `npm install`. 

Then start the it by running `npm run dev` and open a browser
with `http://localhost:3000` 

## Modifying the template

EZ React uses index.ejs as a template for generating index.html. Please refer to (https://github.com/ampedandwired/html-webpack-plugin)[html-webpack-plugin] for instructions. In our webpack config we inject the title as shown above.
